INTRODUCTION                       *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-introduction*

Conjure supports Clojure evaluation over an nREPL connection with optional
CIDER middleware for additional features. The `vim-jack-in` plugin can make
starting an nREPL server from within Neovim trivial, I highly recommend it.

 * https://nrepl.org
 * https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/
 * https://github.com/clojure-vim/vim-jack-in

To get started you can boot an nREPL server and ensure the port was written to
the `.nrepl-port` file. Once it's running all you need to do is open a Clojure
file and start evaluating forms using the generic |conjure-mappings|.

Please note that the CIDER middleware is required for completion in Clojure
and ClojureScript.

MAPPINGS                               *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|. You'll also find a few
commands in here, feel free to set up your own project specific mappings that
call out to them.

See |conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

:ConjureConnect [host] [port]
                         Connect to the given host and port. The host defaults
                         to `clojure.nrepl/connection.default-host`. When no
                         arguments are provided it'll attempt to connect to a
                         port file.
                         `:ConjureConnect staging.my-app.com 5678`
                         `:ConjureConnect 5678`
                         `:ConjureConnect`

:ConjureShadowSelect [build]
                         Select a shadow-cljs build for evaluation within this
                         session. Calls through to the
                         `shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select` function.
                         `:ConjureShadowSelect my-app`
                         https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs

:ConjurePiggieback [code]
                         Piggieback your current session on top of a
                         ClojureScript evaluation environment. You must
                         provide some code to evaluate that returns a REPL
                         environment. This can be used to connect to
                         figwheel-main or nodejs etc.
                         `:ConjurePiggieback (cljs.repl.node/repl-env)`
                         `:ConjurePiggieback (figwheel.main.api/repl-env "dev")`
                         Calls through to `cider.piggieback/cljs-repl`.
                         https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback

:ConjureOutSubscribe     Change `#'*out*` so that it also prints to active
                         sessions, even outside an eval scope.

:ConjureOutUnsubscribe   Change `#'*out*` so that it no longer prints to
                         active sessions outside an eval scope.

<localleader>cd          Disconnect from the current nREPL server.

<localleader>cf          Connect to a server using the port found in any of
                         the files specified by
                         `clojure.nrepl/connection.port-files`.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt the oldest evaluation you have running.

<localleader>ve          View the last exception as data.

<localleader>v1          View the most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>v2          View the 2nd most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>v3          View the 3rd most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>vs          View the source of the symbol under the cursor.

<localleader>sc          Clone the current nREPL session.

<localleader>sf          Create a fresh session from scratch.

<localleader>sq          Close the current session.

<localleader>sQ          Close all sessions.

<localleader>sl          List all sessions.

<localleader>sn          Assume the next session in the list.

<localleader>sp          Assume the previous session in the list.

<localleader>ss          Prompt to select any session in the list.

<localleader>ta          Run all currently loaded tests.

<localleader>tn          Run all tests within this namespace.

<localleader>tN          Run all tests within the alternate namespace to this
                         one. So if you're in `foo.bar` that would be
                         `foo.bar-test` and if you're in `foo.bar-test` it
                         would be `foo.bar`.

<localleader>tc          Run the specific test under the cursor. You can
                         execute this from anywhere in the form much like
                         evaluating the root form under the cursor.

<localleader>rr          Refresh all changed namespaces.

<localleader>ra          Refresh all namespaces, even unchanged.

<localleader>rc          Clear the namespace refresh cache.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                     *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#connection#default_host`
            When connecting to port files or via `:ConjureConnect` this is the
            default host to use.
            Default: `"localhost"`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#connection#port_files`
            List of file paths to check when starting up or hitting
            `<localleader>cf` (by default). They're checked in order, the
            first file to exist has it's contents parsed as a number.
            Conjure will then connect to that port at the host specified by
            `connection.default-host`.
            Conjure checks every directory above your current one as well as
            `~/.config/conjure`, so you can place a default `.nrepl-port`
            file in there to always have a default port to attempt.
            Default: `[".nrepl-port" ".shadow-cljs/nrepl.port"]`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#pretty_print`
            Should results be pretty printed by the nREPL server.
            Relies on `clojure.pprint/write`.
            Default: `true`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#print_quota`
            A hard limit on the number of bytes printed for each value.
            Default: `nil`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#print_buffer_size`
            The size of the buffer to use when streaming results. Defaults to
            1024 within nREPL itself. You can increase this value to reduce
            the amount of messages large results are split up into by nREPL.
            Default: `nil`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#print_function`
            A fully-qualified symbol naming a var whose function to use for
            printing.
            Must point to a function with signature [value writer options].
            Default: `"conjure.internal/pprint"`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#auto_require`
            Automatically require the namespace of any new buffer you open, or
            your current buffer after connection. This ensures buffers you're
            editing are loaded. Can cause side effects you weren't expecting
            if you have side effects at the top level of your namespace.
            Default: `true`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#print_options#level`
            Elide data in the output that surpasses this level of depth with
            the pretty printer. Set it to `false` to disable this limit.
            Default: `50`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#eval#print_options#length`
            Elide data in the output that surpasses this many items, great for
            preventing infinite lazy sequences from melting your CPU. Set it
            to `false` to disable this limit.
            Default: `500`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#interrupt#sample_limit`
            How many characters to show of the code you just interrupted as a
            preview in the log. The value is based on a percentage of the
            width of the full editor.
            Default: `0.3`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#refresh#after`
            The namespace-qualified name of a zero-arity function to call

            Default: `nil`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#test#current_form_names`
            List of keywords that are used to decide if the
            current root form is a test that should be ran.
            Default: `["deftest"]`

`g:conjure#client#clojure#nrepl#test#runner`
            Test runner to use for the various test mappings. The following
            are supported:
             * `"clojure"`
             * `"kaocha"`
            More can be added through contributions where required.
            Default: `"clojure"`
